# NBA Players' Salary Prediction

#Access the 'Main.ipynb' under the ipynb folder for in-depth analysis on prediction models used to run and predict NBA players' salaries.

### Note
We have sub-folders for docs: primarily papers; ipynb: which contains subfolders like EDA, with notebooks organized into chronological order; data: where all data files should live; src: any helper or utility files; and results: notebooks which contain any final pipelines or models, both in serialized Pickle for or in notebooks which can be replicated.

### Also note:
Your first step upon cloning this repo should be to create a folder called "data."
If you check out the `.gitignore` there's a line to block those folders, just so we don't try to push into github and run into issues with the 100 mb limit.
